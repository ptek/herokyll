Herokyll
========

One of the fastest backends for your hakyll generated website ready for publishing on heroku.

Usage:
------

For this you would need a heroku app. You can create it using `heroku create --stack cedar <app name>`

    git clone git://github.com/ptek/herokyll.git <project name>
    cd <project name>
    git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:<app name>.git
    
Now you can write your hakyll website, but make sure, that the built result ends up in `_site` folder

Commit your changes and push the website to heroku by

    git push heroku master
    
This should be it.

Development:
------------

For the development of this heroku plugin you will need 

* [wai-app-static](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-app-static)
* [warp](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp)

To compile the application I used ubuntu linux (10.04)
    
    ghc --make -rtsopts -threaded app.hs

Please do not hesitate to send in a patch or two if you have some ideas or improvements :)
